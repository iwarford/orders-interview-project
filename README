BUILD
-----
To do an initial build, run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

This should also kick off a CPAN session if it needs to install any
dependencies.

This is a Catalyst app using TT2 and Catalyst::Model::DBI -- so
installing those should net most dependencies.  On my local machine
(Xubuntu 14.04) many of the installations were done via apt instead
of CPAN -- however, there should be nothing outside of CPAN needed to
run this.

RUN
---
The simplest way to run is the Catalyst test server -- run

    script/orders_server.pl 

to test the application, and then connect to the application on
localhost:3000.

This should take you to a "Login" page, see the NOTES file for
information about that.

There are facilities to run it from apache via fastcgi, and I have
some experience setting that up, but I'm not going to guarantee that
this will run in your environment, and I have not tested this application
like that -- I have only run it via the test server so far.
